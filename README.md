# Ray Tracing #

This repo contains my work as I'm going through the books by [Peter Shirley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shirley):

* [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B5AODD8/) - also see this [blog post](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html), which contains ideas for extending the code
* [Ray Tracing: the Next Week](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO7PQ8C/)
* [Ray Tracing: the Rest of Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN58P8C/)

He has kindly posted [PDF versions](https://twitter.com/peter_shirley/status/984947257035243520?lang=en), but the Kindle versions are quite inexpensive (and well worth it).
He also has a blog with additional graphics topics: [Pete Shirley's Graphics Blog](http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/).
